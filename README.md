Complete JavaScript Course 2020 Project 3 - Pig Game

This is a course project I coded alongside the Udemy course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: From Zero to Expert" by Jonas Schmedtmann. It is a game where two players roll a dice and choose to hold their current points. If a player gets a 1, then the player loses his current points. The first to reach 100 points wins.
